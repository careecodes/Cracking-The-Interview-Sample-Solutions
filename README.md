# Cracking-The-Interview-Sample-Solutions
Sample solutions for WWC's Cracking the Interview questions

Sample solutions for my problem set for the [WWC DFW Whiteboarding Workshop (Nov 13, 2019)](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Dallas/events/264313074/)

## Prompts:
* Given a string, reverse it in any programming language you know and print the output
* Write pseudo code for solving Towers of Hanoi with 3 towers and 3 discs. 
* [Write a function that simulates rolling a die (1-6)](/roll_die)
* Given a range of numbers 1 to N, find all the prime numbers.
* Numbers to ordinals; given an integer N, return a string that is that number in the form "Nth". Ex: 1=>1st, 5=>5th, 22=>22nd, etc.
* Find the missing numbers! Given an array of sequential numbers, find all the gaps in the sequence.
* Bubble sort - Traverse through a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
* Given a single input string, write a function that produces all possible anagrams of a string and outputs them as an array.
* Make me a randomized Bejeweled grid of 9x9 with 4 piece types where there are no "3 of a kind" in a row (diagonals don't count) and has at least one move available. 
* Check if year is a leap year. 
* Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements. Assume k is always valid, 1<=k<=number of unique elements
